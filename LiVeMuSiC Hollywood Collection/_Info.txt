****Greetings from LiVeMuSiC****

The "Hollywood Collection" I collected in Hollywood, California
from different studios & musicians when I worked as a messenger for Music Express running for the record companies & movie lots in 1986.


I am sharing this collection in the hope that some will use them to a musical advantage to the world.

  There are some GREAT sounds here!
      
     Enjoy!
