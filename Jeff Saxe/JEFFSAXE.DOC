Some comments and suggestions for these voices:


1. "HarpsichNJ":  This is the stock "Harpsich 2" (non-doubled) voice
    from the factory cartridge, but with the realistic-yet-annoying
    jack-cutoff sound removed and the touch sensitivity tweaked.
    Baroque-sounding.

2. "Notorious":  A brass sound with an envelope meant to hint at the
    Roland patch on the Duran Duran song of the same name.

3. "TrapeChord":  Some sort of cross between a harpsichord and a
    trapezoid (hammered dulcimer).  Very forceful in the bass, light
    on the high end.  Try moving the keyboard transpose further up and
    playing very high passages with the sustain pedal on, or turn the
    feedback up to 7 and hit low notes heavily.  Quite versatile.

4. "Bamboo Flt":  Not great, but the bare bones are there for others
    to work on.  Harder playing gives more of the breath sound at the
    beginning.  Try aftertouch giving pitch mod, range about 30, and
    mod wheel giving EG bias, range about 70.

5. "Winwd Solo":  A decent approximation of the famous Steve Winwood
    solo sound which seems to pervade his compositions.  A bit of
    aftertouch or mod wheel (whichever you prefer) pitch mod is
    advisable, as well as a smooth and coordinated pitch-bend
    technique.

6. "HarshDrive":  Aptly named -- harsh and driving.  Play hard and
    loud for best results.  Pentatonics in the low end are great, but
    too far down the keyboard it gets muddy; use caution.  High end is
    O.K. for triad accompaniments.

7. "Rap Beat":  A cute experiment.  Play the low notes with the volume
    and bass turned UP.  Decent keyboard splitting, for a non-
    splitting instrument.

8. "Harp 2M":  Modification of "Harp 2" voice from factory cartridge
    to provide much better response to key velocity and sustain pedal.

9. "Chariots":  Perhaps limited in purpose, but nice-sounding anyway.
    Stay away from pitch modulation, since the downward-sawtooth
    envelope sounds bizarre.

10. "Full Pipes":  Modification of "Pipes 1" voice to lessen delay in
    bass pipe excitement and to induce an EG bias "swell".  Set mod
    wheel to EG bias, range 99, dim the lights, and put "Frankenstein"
    on the VCR.

11. "ChurchPipe":  Modification of "Pipes 2" voice for more churchy
    sound.  Again, mod wheel EG bias at 99 will provide a nice
    "swell".  Turning up the pitch mod sensitivity will provide a bit
    more cheesiness, for those playing revivals or televangelist
    conventions.

12. "ChoirFifth":  Human choir with a fifth-above doubling.  Try
    aftertouch or foot control on EG bias, range somewhere near 99 to
    control the doubling, and mod wheel on amplitude modulation, range
    99 for a tremolo.

13. "SaxophoneM":  Tweaking of "Saxophone" patch in Nov. '87
    AfterTouch magazine.  Try aftertouch on EG bias, range as you like
    it, and mod wheel on pitch mod.

14. "One on One":  Modification of the very nice "Pdl Sweep2" patch
    elsewhere on this BBS.  Set portamento to about 8-19 (glissando
    off) for a fine punchiness (and if you have enough coordination to
    manipulate a portamento on/off pedal, so much the better).  Set
    mod wheel to EG bias, range 99, for quiet passages, and aftertouch
    to a bit of pitch mod (perhaps changing the LFO speed to match the
    mood of the piece).


Enjoy!   -- Jeff Saxe
