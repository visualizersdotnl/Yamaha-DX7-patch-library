DX7 patches by

Notes on using the sounds (from posts on the FM synthisis forum)

Most of my patches do expect several sorts of modulation routings.
Route modulation wheel and pressure with range=99 to pitch.
Route modulation footpedal to amplitude, range=99
I usually also have a footswitch to turn portamento on/off
and have the data entry slider set to the portamento time.
This gives maximum benefit of these patches.


The modulation is really important for these sounds. They were not originally made with publication in mind. I always have my DX7 set up with specific modulation routings, to react on pressure, velocity, mod wheel, mod pedal, portament switch etc. 
Unfortunately the function settings are not saved, as far as I know. 

For full enjoyment of the ABACAB sound, set portamento time=1 and glissando=off.
All the Moogy sounds, including From The Beginning, obviously require a portmento time in the range 15-30. The "Ravine" should also have a fairly fast portamento and sounds fantastic with a huge delay. Pressure should be routed to the same as mod wheel, so pressure gives it tremolo. (This is something that holds for all the sounds).

I usually also play sounds like the Moog1, Heroes, Prophet and ABACAB through an old Boss Flanger, which gives an extra huge analog-like sound.
